    "description": "<p> Embarking on a mission to transform EDI's (Effetti Digitali Italiani) outdated website, our team set out to craft a digital showpiece for this Milan-based visual effects giant, famed for work with Disney, Marvel, and other big names. Our tools for this creative venture? A blend of WordPress, enhanced by Typescript, PHP, SCSS, and the ingenious use of ACF for smooth BackOffice data handling. <br/> <br/> The goal was clear: create a site that's not only a feast for the eyes but also a magnet for potential clients and top-tier talent. Among our triumphs was mastering a custom search functionality â€“ a notorious challenge in the WordPress universe. <br/> <br/> Another major feat? Seamlessly integrating over 1,500 projects into the website, ensuring each one was showcased in all its glory. The result is a website that mirrors EDI's reputation for breathtaking visual effects, now reflected in a digital space where every pixel and line of code captures the audience's imagination. </p>",
